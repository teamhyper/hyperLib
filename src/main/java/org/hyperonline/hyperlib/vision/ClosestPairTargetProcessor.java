/**
 * Target processor which finds the closest two targets to the crosshairs, and
 * averages their position. This is the algorithm that was used to track the
 * boiler in the 2017 steamworks game. It can more generally be applied to
 * anything that's two pieces of tape.
 * <p>
 * This processor uses the height of the targets to measure distance. However,
 * it computes x, y, and height all as simple averages, rather than weighting by
 * depth. This is a good approximation as long as one target is not
 * significantly closer than the other, meaning the camera is not viewing the
 * target from a steep angle.
