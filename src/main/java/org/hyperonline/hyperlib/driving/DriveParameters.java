 * The {@link DriveParameters} interface allows one to use polymorphism to
 * represent the various drive modes of the robot, such as tank drive, arcade
 * drive, meccanum drive (Cartesian or polar), swerve drive, etc. A single
 * instance of {@link DriveParameters} should contain a specific set of values
 * for one of those modes.
 * 
 * Using this interface, one can drive the robot by continuously supplying the
 * drive train with {@link DriveParameters} objects. One can also create new
 * drive modes and switch between modes without having to modify the drivetrain
 * subsystem, or write separate commands for each mode. See the hypercode2016
 * userDrive class for a good example of this.
